This example contains the configuration files for the following setup:

	node 2: DIG node with local output toggle
	node 6: DHT node with local output toggle and temperature / humidity measurement
	node 4: RC node that controls a klikaanklikuit switch at address C1
	

The standard DIG and DHT nodes have been configured to:

- send an state message after every write commando from openhab; ACK has been set to TRUE.
- send a state message after each local toggle of the output.

In this way the node sends a status message after each output change, whether it is generated by openhab or by pushing the button on the node.
The rules-file contains rules to inspect these messages, and update the Openhab status of the output accordingly.
In this way the openhab status is set by a feedback message received from the node, in this way always reflecting the true state. If somehow the command has not reached the node, (bad radiosignal) the status in openhab is not changed.

Most of the time a small delay can be observed between pressing the button in the Openhab UI and the state change in the UI. This delay is due to the time it needs to process and send/receive all messages.

ITEMS
In the items-file a switch is configured to store the received status of the output. The received commands (ON/OFF) are translated into states that Openhab understands (OPEN/CLOSED) for a switch.
To display the status in the UI the following icons must be copied in folder /usr/share/openhab/webapps/images:

	light-on.png must be copied to lamp-open.png
	light-off.png must be copied to lamp-closed.png
	
RULES
In this file rules are included to:
	- read RSSI values on node 2 once a minute
	- update output values for node2 and node 6
	- switch a light on and off via node 4 (klikaanklikuit) at preset times each day
